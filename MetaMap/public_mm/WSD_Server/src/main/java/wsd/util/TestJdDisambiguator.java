The product resulting from the reaction of TBA with lymphocytes was extracted with n-butyl and fluorescence intensity was determined.  The degree of lipid peroxidation, expressed as fluorescence intensity f547, was assessed for stimulation of lymphocytes with concanavalin A (Con A), and was related to lymphocyte proliferation in response to Con A if Se was administered. The lymphocyte proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, expressed as cpm. The effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD), added to cell culture on lymphocyte proliferation was also evaluated. It was found that LPO in lymphocytes before Con A stimulation was significantly less than that after stimulation (p < 0.001), and that SOD promoted lymphocyte proliferation dose dependently. The addition of Na2Seo3 to lymphocyte culture or supplementation in drinking water to mice decreased the produced LPO in lymphocyte in response to Con A. In the presence of Se, there is an inverse correlation between the levels of LPO in lymphocyte and the stimulated proliferation (r = -0.8902, r = -0.9439). In conclusion, active oxygen species scavenging was proposed as one of the mechanisms for Se to promote immunity.");
